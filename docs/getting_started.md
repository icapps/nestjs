# Getting started

## 1. Install NestJS CLI as a global dependency

```bash
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
```

## 2. Create a new NestJS project

```bash
nest new project-name --strict
```

## 3. Add support for Swagger

For now, we recommend following along with [NestJS' official documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction). We will revisit this later to take multiple environments into account.

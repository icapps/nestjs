## Usage

### Build

To build all packages, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Publish

We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to take care of versioning and publishing.

To publish a new release of any or more packages, all you need to do is run the following command and follow the instructions:

```bash
npm run release
```

This will create a changeset that you need to push to GitHub. A release PR will be created, which should publish the package(s) to npm when being merged.

## Contributing

to discuss what you would like to change.
